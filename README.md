# brawl.rs
An experimental Rust server with Supercell's packet decoding.

## Setting up.
1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Download/clone repository.
3. Type into console `cargo build`
4. Go to `/target/debug/`
5. Launch executable file

* Now you can connect through any Supercell game client with frida injection!

## Why game isn't loading?
Because this server doesn't have any logic.
